# fixing-a-reported-issue eval status

A live `waza run` against the committed eval suite (`evals/fixing-a-reported-issue/`,
copilot-sdk executor, `claude-sonnet-4.6`, 2026-07-17) scored 0/4 on the
grader, but manual review of all 4 transcripts found every response
semantically correct (the guardrail task explicitly refused to skip the
failing-test step; both unreproducible-defect tasks correctly escalated) --
the grader's exact-substring checks are too brittle for this suite's
paraphrase-tolerant scoring, not a skill regression. No no-skill baseline is
recorded, cross-model behavior remains unmeasured.

Separately, a 2026-07-17 `battle-testing-a-skill` pass gave a conditional
pass: the hard-gated reproduce/escalate/fix/verify sequence is procedurally
sound and fail-closed, but Step 1 instructs executing "the issue's reported
reproduction steps directly against the real code path" with no restated
caveat that issue text is untrusted, there is no defined behavior for an
issue with no reproduction steps, and no branch distinguishes "could not
attempt reproduction" from "attempted and failed." A companion
`evaluating-skill-quality` pass rated it well-formed but not mature: Step
3/4's rules are near-verbatim duplicated in Stop boundaries, and no
feedback-loop instruction exists for what to do if Step 5's verification
fails. Refs #128.
